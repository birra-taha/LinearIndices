# LinearIndices

This repository will serve as an open repository for clinicians and researchers who are interested in accessing data related to a soon-to-published paper entitled: "Evaluating linear heuristics for ventricular volume in healthy adults using a fully automated algorithm: implications for defining the normal"

# Source Data
MRI Data is sourced exclusively from the IXI public data respository (https://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/). An open-access dataset of MRI images from healthy adults between the ages of 20-86. Images were obtained using three different scanners: 1) Phillips Medical Systems Intera 3T, 2)  Philips Medical Systems Gyroscan Intera 1.5T, 3) General Electric 1.5T. Images obtained are high resolution T1-weighted images (matrix size = 256 x 256 x 150; resolution = 0.9375 mm × 0.9375 mm × 1.2 mm). 

# Data related to the paper
We provide the complete data in one file denoted "data.tsv". Rows are IXI subjects. Columns are: Frontal Horn Width, Occipital Horn Width,
