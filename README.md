# LinearIndices

This public repository will serve clinicians and researchers who are interested in accessing data related to a submitted paper entitled: <i>"Evaluating linear heuristics for ventricular volume in healthy adults using a fully automated algorithm: implications for defining the normal"</i>

# Source Data
MRI Data is sourced exclusively from the IXI public data respository <i> (https://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/)</i>. An open-access dataset of MRI images from healthy adults between the ages of 20-86. Images were obtained using three different scanners: 1) Phillips Medical Systems Intera 3T, 2)  Philips Medical Systems Gyroscan Intera 1.5T, 3) General Electric 1.5T. Images obtained are high resolution T1-weighted images (matrix size = 256 x 256 x 150; resolution = 0.9375 mm × 0.9375 mm × 1.2 mm).
